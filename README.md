# E-commerce-Product-Page

This website was inspired from the challenge at https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6. I made a modified version of the challenge.


I used HTML, CSS and Vanilla Js. Increased my knowledge on DOM manipulation and how to manipulate arrays.
